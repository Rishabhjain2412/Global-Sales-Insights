Global sales Insights

We will be looking at a sales dataset that contains product sales information throughout the United States. The dataset contains various customer-related details, including customer names, order and shipment dates, product names, product categories and subcategories, profit made, and so on.

VISUALIZATION CHARTS WHICH ARE USED TO CREATE THIS DASHBOARD ARE AS FOLLOWS:-
1.	Slicer
2.	Maps
3.	Cards
4.	Pie chart
5.	Donut chart
6.	Stacked column chart
7.	Stacked bar chart
8.	CLUSTERED COLUMN

According to the dataset and queries, I have transformed the data and categorized it by the country that is USA. Then analysed the dataset using Slicer tool to divide it according to financial years and divided it into quarter to get the detailed info about the profits for the products. 
Created a few columns in the table like total sales, quantity, average day for delivery, year and a few more to get the complete detailed information and represent them on the CARD individually. Tried to create the MAP that represent all the cities in USA where our product is being used by the consumer and calculated the sum of revenue generated from that location. 
Divided the totals sales into 3 segments by using PIE CHART according to the type of user that are Consumer, Corporate and Home office.
Divided the sales into the category of the order that are Technology, Office supply and Furniture and used DONUT CHART to represent that.
Calculated Profits and Loss and divided them according to the region and used STACKED COLUNM CHART.
Calculated profits by category by using STACKED BAR CHART
Used CLUSTERED COLUMN CHART to represent the top 10 cities also.
